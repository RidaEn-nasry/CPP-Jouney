# A Mono-myth To The C++-ish Jungle.

This module was a deep introduction to C++ specifically c++98 standard The conclusion or the light bulb i’ve got from this project is just an enforcing argument to an already concluded idea: <br>
> Quality code is generic code, code is not to be too problem narrowed , the more cases a code can handle the better, and i think this is what all c++ about, as Stoustrap alluded to he said that industry’s specific languages were the flavour of the day at the time (Simula… ) and he wanted to create something that can be used in mathematical computations as well as industry and brothers, at least i’m sure as hell that’s all what STL about, i developed this gute before i knew C++, now i’m just more sure, don’t ignore the generality of nature.
