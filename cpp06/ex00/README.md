### Scalar types   
As most concepts in CS, scalar type concept is stupidly confusing, and naively misused, not because it's actually a complex concept by heart, it's actually as simple as baby shit. but because it has many definitions which totally goes against it's native meaning in literal language. 
Scalar in the fat dictionary stands for:
> **A quantity such as mass, length, or speed that is completely specified by its magnitude and has no direction.**<br> 


In layman language it's something that can represent scale or volume. However this is the [definition](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/1995/N0774.pdf) of scalar type in c++ open standard specification: 
>  **Scalars are primitive objects which contain a single value and are not composed of other C++ objects.**<br>

Again in layman language it means a scalar type is a type which exist natively in the language (int, char, double) , and it only contains one single and sole value , not two not three, for example **int** is a scalar type , it's built-in in c++ and cannot be decomposed into further data types it's like an atom, thus scalar types are also called **atomic types** , an example of non-scalar types is arrays, arrays are native c++ data types however they're composite, they contains many values of something, (array of ints, chars...), thus they're not scalar types. because they go against rule 2.0 of scalar types, the one that says no fucking decomposability. another example is **boolean** **is it native ?** good, rule 1.0 checked, **is it composite ?** i don't think so, thus boolean is a scalar type. <br>
Now in you case you not confused yet, let me confuse you, What in the fuck does a boolean has to do with a quantity or a scale, the answer is nothing, and whoever wrote this specification should buy a fucking dictionary.
